# Comparative study of Java and Kotlin for Android development (scientific article)

__ABSTRACT:__ Android development has traditionally been dominated by Java, a language known for its reliability and extensive history. However, the emergence of Kotlin language created by JetBrains in 2011 and its subsequent adoption by Google* as the official language for Android development in 2017 changed the situation. The main purpose of this paper is to conduct a comparative analysis of Java and Kotlin, focusing on syntax, performance,developer productivity and community acceptance, and to develop an understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of both languages in the context of Android development.

__Keywords:__ _Java, Kotlin, programming, Android development, programming languages comparison, syntax._
